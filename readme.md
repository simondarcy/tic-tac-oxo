# Tic Tac OxO
### An unbeatable game of tic tac toe using minimax algorithm

**Inspiration**

When I used to work in a supermarket I used to play Tic Tac Toe with OxO Cube boxes whenever I was asked to "face off" the aisle in which contained them.

**AI**

This game uses the minimax algorithm making the game unbeatable

**!Todo**

The plan is to allow for two. Initially this will just be an option not to play the computer but the I then aim to make this playable online using web sockets.
